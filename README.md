## About

This project is a mobile application developed with React Native and Expo, for coffee delivery. In the app, you can view the most diverse coffee flavors, in addition to viewing them in categories. You can also see more details about a coffee, select a size and quantity, and add it to the cart. After choosing your favorite coffees, you have the option to delete an item from the cart or complete the order.

The focus of this project was to implement **animations, microinteractions, visual, tactile and sound feedback**. So here are some technologies used:

- TypeScript
- React Native
- Expo
- Expo AV (sound feedback)
- Expo Haptics (tactile feedback)
- React Native Skia (visual feedback and animations)
- React Native Reanimated (animations)
- React Native Gesture Handler (microinteractions)
- Jotai (state management)

Additionally, this project was developed during [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) React Native training challenge. The project's Figma can be accessed through the link below.
